IA626 Final Project Outline:

NYS Trout Fishing Locator:
Each year DEC releases approximately 900,000 pounds of fish into more than 1,200 public streams, rivers, lakes and ponds across the state. I'll combine the number of stocking in diferernt area and the access locations of rivers and streams for fishing in New York State to see if we could find a good trout fishing spot nearby with input zipcode.
